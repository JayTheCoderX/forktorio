Adds forks to factorio

I felt Factorio doesn't have enough plastic utensils. Well, I thought I'd fix that problem: Presenting: FORKTORIO. Forktorio is considered by several plastic spoons to be one of the most innovative, ground-breaking mods to have ever been released for Factorio, or any game, really. Be warned that the mod does not feature any low resolution graphics, and so if your computer is a potato it might be overcome by the sheer power of the forks.
